Yeah, some Slovakian dude. 

### Hymna stránky

Točí filmy, dělá hudbu a všude se rve

Born in New Zealand in sixty-four
A hot-headed actor named Russell Crowe
He loves to act but he loves one thing more
Fightin' Round The World

He fights his directors and he fights his fans
It's a problem no one understands
If there's two things he loves it's fighting and
Fightin' Round The World

Makin' movies, makin' music and
Fight-in' Round The World!
Russell Crowe!

Tugger's whistle's blowin
Means we must be goin
No more Russell Crowein' for you.

But now don't you start to whine
I'll see ya again next time
Cos there's plenty a-more a-fightin' left to do.
Makin' movies, makin' songs
An' fightin' round the world
